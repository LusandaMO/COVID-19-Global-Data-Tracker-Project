# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-Project
# COVID-19 Data Analysis with Python

## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the COVID-19 dataset provided by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data). Using Python, the analysis dives into trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries to uncover key insights and patterns.

## Objectives
- Load and clean the COVID-19 dataset to ensure accuracy and usability.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and anomalies.
- Visualize trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations for selected countries (Kenya, India, and the United States).
- Highlight key insights and provide recommendations based on the analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used
The following tools and libraries were used to complete the project:
- **Python**
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib`: To create visualizations such as line and bar charts.
  - `seaborn`: For enhanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **Google Colab**: For interactive coding and visualization.

## How to Run/View the Project
1. **Dataset**: Ensure you have the `owid-covid-data.csv` file from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data).
2. **Steps**:
   - Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`owid_covid_analysis.ipynb`) in Google Colab.
   - Upload the `owid-covid-data.csv` dataset to the Colab environment.
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to see the data loading, cleaning, analysis, and vis

## Insights & Reflections
### Key Insights:
1. **Cases**:
   - India experienced a significant spike in cases during the Delta variant wave in mid-2021.
   - The United States showed a steady decline in cases after vaccine rollout.
   - Kenya exhibited smaller, distinct waves of cases, reflecting differences in population density and testing/reporting.

2. **Vaccinations**:
   - The United States had the fastest vaccine rollout among the selected countries.
   - India caught up with the United States by late 2021, showcasing a rapid increase in vaccinations.
   - Kenya faced challenges in achieving higher vaccination rates, with less than 30% coverage by the end of 2021.

3. **Death Rates**:
   - Death rates decreased significantly over time for all countries, indicating the positive effects of vaccination and improved healthcare responses.
   - India faced a higher death rate during the Delta wave, emphasizing the strain on healthcare systems.

4. **Anomalies**:
   - Kenya's data occasionally showed missing or zero values for new cases and vaccinations, suggesting gaps in reporting.

### Reflections:
- The analysis highlights the critical role of vaccinations in reducing COVID-19 cases and deaths globally.
- Data collection and reporting mechanisms need improvement in certain regions to ensure accurate analysis and decision-making.
- Future analysis could explore socioeconomic factors influencing vaccination rates and healthcare accessibility.
